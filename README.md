== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why is the plugin called Social Connect if I can only connect to Twitter? =

The plugin is still in active development and we will include more functionalities in further updates. We felt that a lot of users needed a simple way to display tweets on their website and we wanted to publish our plugin to cover that need. The OAuth Library allows us to connect new service provider like Facebook, LinkedIn, Github in the future.
