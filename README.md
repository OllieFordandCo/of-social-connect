Plugin that uses the OAuth Library to help you connect with Social Network (currently only Twitter) and registers widgets and shortcodes to use on the front end of your website.

== Description ==

This is the long description.  No limit, and you can use Markdown (as well as in the following sections).

For backwards compatibility, if this section is missing, the full length of the short description will be used, and
Markdown parsed.

A few notes about the sections above:

*   "Contributors" is a comma separated list of wp.org/wp-plugins.org usernames
*   "Tags" is a comma separated list of tags that apply to the plugin
*   "Requires at least" is the lowest version that the plugin will work on
*   "Tested up to" is the highest version that you've *successfully used to test the plugin*. Note that it might work on
higher versions... this is just the highest one you've verified.
*   Stable tag should indicate the Subversion "tag" of the latest stable version, or "trunk," if you use `/trunk/` for
stable.

    Note that the `readme.txt` of the stable tag is the one that is considered the defining one for the plugin, so
if the `/trunk/readme.txt` file says that the stable tag is `4.3`, then it is `/tags/4.3/readme.txt` that'll be used
for displaying information about the plugin.  In this situation, the only thing considered from the trunk `readme.txt`
is the stable tag pointer.  Thus, if you develop in trunk, you can update the trunk `readme.txt` to reflect changes in
your in-development version, without having that information incorrectly disclosed about the current stable version
that lacks those changes -- as long as the trunk's `readme.txt` points to the correct stable tag.

    If no stable tag is provided, it is assumed that trunk is stable, but you should specify "trunk" if that's where
you put the stable version, in order to eliminate any doubt.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why is the plugin called Social Connect if I can only connect to Twitter? =

The plugin is still in active development and we will include more functionalities in further updates. We felt that a lot of users needed a simple way to display tweets on their website and we wanted to publish our plugin to cover that need. The OAuth Library allows us to connect new service provider like Facebook, LinkedIn, Github in the future. It you wish to colaborate in the creation, please, visit or Github (https://github.com/OllieFordandCo/ollieford-social-connect/) where you can fork and commit changes to the plugin.
